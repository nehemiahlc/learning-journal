            <h1>My new journey as a frontend developer. Default text</h1>
            <p>
                After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, 
                I've been steadily building real-world projects to sharpen my skills 
                and document my journey as a developer.

                <h2>How I stay committed to learning</h2>
                <p>
                    I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to 
                    spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple 
                    projects using what I learned or work new techniques into 
                    existing projects.
    
                    While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share
                    what I was learning and most things about my journey with 
                    the world.
                </p>

                <h2>How I got started</h2>
                <p>
                    I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site.
                    I would take notes about what I was learning. After each 
                    learning session, I'd use my notes to not
                    only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries 
                    of what I learned using my own words.

                    That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that 
                    posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and 
                    stay motivated.
